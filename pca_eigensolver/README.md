# pca_eigensolver
(Manually perform PCA by finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors)

As part of a series of "Math for AI/ML" sessions I'm teaching for my fellow coworkers, I started the series by focusing on one of the most fundamental and important and topics in math that's used everyday in our digital lives -- linear algebra.

linear_algebra_pca.py demonstrates a practical application of linear algebra by showing how PCA can be performed by using eigendecomposition.
